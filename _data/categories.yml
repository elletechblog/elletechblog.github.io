Others are filled with excitement as they imagine what's waiting on the other side. But one thing is clear, if we have to make it across the ere, we cannot do it one small step at a time. Living on the edge of the 4th Industrial Revolution means being bold with new partnerships, new playbooks, new resources, and most of all, the confidence, courage and commitment to take a flying leap."

One of the key issues today concerns the place of the human person in this new environment of increasing digital complexity, that not only expands the range of his or her capacities but also may compete with them or even replace them.

  - articles: "There is a classical distinction between information, knowledge and wisdom. How to get the wisdom from the knowledge, and the knowledge from the information, are longstanding multi-faceted questions. I will not claim to have life-shattering wisdom to instill to you. What I can do here is tell you stories -- my stories. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua. As for the extraction of meaning, I will leave that to you."

You don’t need to do everything. I'd love to hear about your side of the hustle."
